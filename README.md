This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text
The model classifies text into three categories:
✅ Positive
❌ Negative
⚖️ Neutral
Sentiment Analysis helps analyze opinions and understand emotions expressed in textual data

The main goal of this project is to:
Analyze textual data
Identify emotional tone
Classify sentiment accurately
Support data-driven decision-making

Technologies Used:
->Python
->Panda
->NumPy
->Scikit-learn
->TensorFlow / Keras 

Workflow:
1.Data Collection
2.Text Preprocessing
Before training the model:
->Convert text to lowercase
->Remove punctuation
->Remove stopwords
->Tokenization
->Stemming or Lemmatization

3.Model Training:
The processed data is trained using machine learning or deep learning algorithms such as:
->Logistic Regression
->Naive Bayes
->Support Vector Machine
->LSTM / Neural Networks
The model learns patterns associated with each sentiment category

4.Prediction:
After training:
->New text is given to the model
->The text is preprocessed
->Converted into numerical format
->The model predicts the sentiment
